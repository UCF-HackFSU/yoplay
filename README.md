Yo + Google StreetView = 50% Game, 50% Social Experiment, 100% Yo.
-
YoPlay was built to be played within Yo. No other apps are needed! Just Yo. We took Yo's quick and simple API and expanded on it to create a living, growing, location-based social experiment that's also fun to play!

How to...YoPlay
-
1. Subscribe to/Add JUSTYOPLAY to your Yo
2. Just Yo.
3. Open the Yo Link, If you think you know where the location given is, go there!
4. Then simply Yo your location (aka double tap on JUSTYOPLAY)
5. If it's correct, you'll se a new location, if not, you need to get closer to the clue!
